- investigate [bounter](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/bounter) for counting
- ~~consistent naming (`bgr`/`bigram`)~~
- new steps should copy and modify, not overwrite original data (for debugging)
- ~~replace `del` with `dict.pop(key, None)`, so that we can conditionally check that a value has been removed~~
- performance
- multiprocessing?
- removing low frequency Lexemes and Bigrams from BigramData.
  - Replace with a single `PRUNED` lexeme?
- ~~`WinningBigram` data structure (merge token count, merged_token: Lexeme, locations, etc)~~
- Stop after a log-likelihood threshold is met (elbow method?)
- docstrings
- invalid log value warning
